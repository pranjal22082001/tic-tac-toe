# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! This project is a simple implementation of the classical game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is for a player to place their symbol (usually 'X' or 'O') in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, thus forming a line of three of their symbols. The game is typically played on a piece of paper or a board, but it can also be implemented digitally.
